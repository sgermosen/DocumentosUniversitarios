<!-- 
	This file contains important information used by the FrontPage client
	(the FrontPage Explorer and FrontPage Editor) to communicate with the
	FrontPage server extensions installed on this web server.

	The values below are automatically set by FrontPage at installation.  Normally, you do not need to modify these values, but in case
	you do, the parameters are as follows:

	'FPShtmlScriptUrl', 'FPAuthorScriptUrl', and 'FPAdminScriptUrl' specify
	the relative urls for the scripts that FrontPage uses for remote
	authoring.  These values should not be changed.

	'FPVersion' identifies the version of the FrontPage Server Extensions
	installed, and should not be changed.
